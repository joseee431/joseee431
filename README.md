## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and a recent graduate, excited to start my career. I enjoy programming machine learning algorithms in Python, solving logic problems, and reading papers on AI advancements. My passion is Natural Language Processing; in fact, my thesis was titled: *Exploration of Clusters through Unsupervised Learning of Text Representations Generated by BETO and Word2Vec for Tweets in Mexican Spanish*. I also enjoy watching action movies, wrestling, and technology videos.
